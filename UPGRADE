Upgrade instructions for UseModWiki 0.92
Last updated: April 21, 2001
See the INSTALL file for new installations.

Please email usemod@usemod.com with any questions, comments, or suggestions.

------
Upgrading from 0.90 or 0.91:

1. Make a backup of your current wiki script and your database directory
   ($DataDir).

2. Copy the wiki.pl file to your cgi-bin directory, overwriting your
   old wiki script.  You may need to change the permissions on the
   new script file.

3. Edit the wiki script in your cgi-bin directory, and change the line
   reading: $DataDir     = "/tmp/mywikidb"; # Main wiki directory
   ...to point to your existing wiki database directory.

4. If you are using the "config"-file method for your wiki settings,
   you can stop here (if you accept the defaults for new settings below).
   If you want to change these settings, copy the appropriate lines from
   the wiki.pl script to your config file and change them there.

5. If you did *not* use the config-file method for your settings, change
   the settings in the new script to match your old script.

Note that the default settings enable the "free-links" feature.  If you
want to continue using a "traditional" wiki (that does not allow free-links),
you should change $FreeLinks to 0.  See the setting section below for
more information.

------
Upgrading from 0.86 or 0.88:

Version 0.92 of UseModWiki uses a different internal database for
storing page data.  It requires a conversion script (um9cvt.pl) to
upgrade version 0.86 or 0.88 wikis to 0.92.

See http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?UseModWiki/Upgrade for
detailed upgrade instructions.

------
New configuration settings:

New settings as of 0.92:

$StyleSheet  = "";              # URL for CSS stylesheet (like "/wiki.css")

  The URL for an external CSS stylesheet.

$NotFoundPg  = "";              # Page for not-found links ("" for blank pg)

  If a page is not found by an ordinary link (like wiki.pl?SomePage), this
option allows a special not-found page to be displayed rather than the
usual blank "Describe this page here." message.  It is probably most useful
for sites with more visitors than editors, or as a kind of "404" page in
case wiki pages are deleted or renamed.

$FooterNote  = "";              # HTML for bottom of every page

  The contents of $FooterNote will be displayed at the bottom of every
normal wiki page (some error messages will not display this message).  It is
raw HTML, so make sure you escape special characters properly.

$EditNote    = "";              # HTML Notice above buttons on edit page

  This is like $FooterNote, but it is displayed on the editing page.  It is
a good place for a brief policy note about contributed content.

$MaxPost     = 1024 * 210;      # Maximum 210K posts (about 200K for pages)

  The maximum accepted size of a POST (edit) request in bytes.  Page
submissions beyond this size will not be accepted.  This may be useful to
prevent simple denial-of-service attacks.

$NewText     = "";              # New page text ("" for default message)

  The text that is inserted into a newly-created page.  Leave this setting
blank to keep the default message.

$HttpCharset = "";              # Charset for pages, like "iso-8859-2"

  If non-blank, this charset will be used in the HTTP header.  This may be
most useful for non-English wikis.

$UserGotoBar = "";              # HTML added to end of goto bar

  If non-blank, this is added to the end of the goto/link bar on each page.

$RunCGI      = 1;       # 1 = Run script as CGI,  0 = Load but do not run

  For those who are using mod_perl, FastCGI, or similar persistent-CGI
systems, set this variable to 0 *in the script* in order to prevent the
script from running as soon as it is loaded.  See the PersistentCGI page on
the UseMod wiki for more details.

$UseLookup   = 1;       # 1 = lookup host names,  0 = skip lookup (IP only)

  If saving a page takes a long time (20 or more seconds), try changing
this setting to 0.

$FreeUpper   = 1;       # 1 = force upper case,   0 = do not force case

  The new 0.92 code by default forces all words in a page-title to start
with an uppercase letter.  (A link like [[This is a link]] will go to
a page named [[This Is A Link]].)  This convention allows similar links
(differing only in case) to point to the same page.

  Sites that use sentences as links might not want this behavior, so the
$FreeUpper setting allows it to be disabled.  Note that the first letter
of the first word is still *always* uppercased regardless of this setting.

$FastGlob    = 1;       # 1 = new faster code,    0 = old compatible code

  Thanks to user feedback the indexing code has been greatly improved.
In case of problems, however, the old code is available.

$EmbedWiki   = 0;       # 1 = no headers/footers, 0 = normal wiki pages

  Normally this setting will be kept at 0.  If set to 1, only the wiki
text of each page will be displayed (no headers, linkbars, footers, search
forms, or logos are displayed).

New settings as of 0.91:

$HomePage    = "HomePage";      # Home page (change space to _)

  This option existed in 0.90, but it can now accept free-link names
(if $FreeLinks is set to 1).  For example, $HomePage = "My_Home_Page";
would make the homepage be "My Home Page".  Note that _ characters are
required instead of spaces.

$RCName      = "RecentChanges"; # Name of changes page (change space to _)

  The name of the RecentChanges page can now be changed.  Like the $HomePage
option, free-link names are allowed with spaces changed to _ characters
(like "My_Recent_Changes").

# Major options:
$FreeLinks   = 1;       # 1 = use [[word]] links, 0 = LinkPattern only

  This is the biggest change in 0.91.  Pages can now have names with spaces
and limited punctuation.  (See the online documentation for more details.)
If you do not want this feature in your wiki, change this setting to 0.

$WikiLinks   = 1;       # 1 = use LinkPattern,    0 = use [[word]] only

  If you are using the FreeLinks feature, you can *optionally* set
$WikiLinks to 0 to disable automatic linking of text matching the LinkPattern.
If you set this to 0, the only links in the text will be those created
with double-brackets (like [[word]]).  This may be useful if a site wishes
to use [[word]]-style links exclusively and doesn't want AccidentalLinking.

$AdminDelete = 1;       # 1 = Admin only page,    0 = Editor can delete pages

  If set to 0, the "action=editlinks" feature will be available for logins
with a valid editor password (as well as admins).  Note that the editlinks
feature can completely and irreversably erase pages and RecentChanges-log
entries.

# Minor options:
$UseIndex    = 0;       # 1 = use index file,     0 = slow/reliable method

  This is not a new option, but the default value is changed from the 0.90
release.  Some sites have experienced problems with pages showing up as
not defined after the page was created.  Setting $UseIndex to 0 eliminated
the problem.  For small sites (less than 500 pages) this setting will not
matter much.  Larger sites may want to try setting $UseIndex to 1 as it
should speed up actions like searching and the "Random Page" link.

$UseHeadings = 1;       # 1 = allow = h1 text =,  0 = no header formatting

  New formatting.  Text like ==h2 text== is rendered like <h2>h2 text</h2>.  
The number of "=" characters determines the header number.

$NetworkFile = 1;       # 1 = allow remote file:, 0 = no file:// links

  If enabled, file:// links to remote sites will be enabled.  Local
file:// links are disabled because of possible problems with links
like file:///C:/Windows/calc.exe (substituting a bad program instead).

$BracketWiki = 0;       # 1 = [WikiLnk txt] link, 0 = no local descriptions

  In 0.90, text like [WikiLink any text here] became a link which looked
like [any text here], pointing to WikiLink.  This occasionally caused
problems with things like category lists like [CategoryAlpha CategoryBeta].
This behavior is now optional, and is disabled by default.  If you want
the 0.90 behavior of local described-links, change this setting to 1.
