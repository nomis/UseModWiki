Upgrade instructions for UseModWiki 0.91
Last updated: February 11, 2001
See the INSTALL file for new installations.

Please email usemod@usemod.com with any questions, comments, or suggestions.

------
Upgrading from 0.90:

1. Make a backup of your current wiki script and database directory
   ($DataDir).

2. Copy the wiki.pl file to your cgi-bin directory, overwriting your
   old wiki script.  You may need to change the permissions on the
   new script file.

3. Edit the wiki script in your cgi-bin directory, and change the line
   reading: $DataDir     = "/tmp/mywikidb"; # Main wiki directory
   ...to point to your existing wiki database directory.

4. If you are using the "config"-file method for your wiki settings,
   you can stop here (if you accept the defaults for new settings below).
   If you want to change these settings, copy the appropriate lines from
   the wiki.pl script to your config file and change them there.

5. If you did *not* use the config-file method for your settings, change
   the settings in the new script to match your old script.

Note that the default settings enable the "free-links" feature.  If you
want to continue using a "traditional" wiki (that does not allow free-links),
you should change $FreeLinks to 0.  See the setting section below for
more information.

------
Upgrading from 0.86 or 0.88:

Version 0.91 of UseModWiki uses a different internal database for
storing page data.  It requires a conversion script (um9cvt.pl) to
upgrade version 0.86 or 0.88 wikis to 0.91.

See http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?UseModWiki/Upgrade for
detailed upgrade instructions.

------
New configuration settings:

$HomePage    = "HomePage";      # Home page (change space to _)

  This option existed in 0.90, but it can now accept free-link names
(if $FreeLinks is set to 1).  For example, $HomePage = "My_Home_Page";
would make the homepage be "My Home Page".  Note that _ characters are
required instead of spaces.

$RCName      = "RecentChanges"; # Name of changes page (change space to _)

  The name of the RecentChanges page can now be changed.  Like the $HomePage
option, free-link names are allowed with spaces changed to _ characters
(like "My_Recent_Changes").

# Major options:
$FreeLinks   = 1;       # 1 = use [[word]] links, 0 = LinkPattern only

  This is the biggest change in 0.91.  Pages can now have names with spaces
and limited punctuation.  (See the online documentation for more details.)
If you do not want this feature in your wiki, change this setting to 0.

$WikiLinks   = 1;       # 1 = use LinkPattern,    0 = use [[word]] only

  If you are using the FreeLinks feature, you can *optionally* set
$WikiLinks to 0 to disable automatic linking of text matching the LinkPattern.
If you set this to 0, the only links in the text will be those created
with double-brackets (like [[word]]).  This may be useful if a site wishes
to use [[word]]-style links exclusively and doesn't want AccidentalLinking.

$AdminDelete = 1;       # 1 = Admin only page,    0 = Editor can delete pages

  If set to 0, the "action=editlinks" feature will be available for logins
with a valid editor password (as well as admins).  Note that the editlinks
feature can completely and irreversably erase pages and RecentChanges-log
entries.

# Minor options:
$UseIndex    = 0;       # 1 = use index file,     0 = slow/reliable method

  This is not a new option, but the default value is changed from the 0.90
release.  Some sites have experienced problems with pages showing up as
not defined after the page was created.  Setting $UseIndex to 0 eliminated
the problem.  For small sites (less than 500 pages) this setting will not
matter much.  Larger sites may want to try setting $UseIndex to 1 as it
should speed up actions like searching and the "Random Page" link.

$UseHeadings = 1;       # 1 = allow = h1 text =,  0 = no header formatting

  New formatting.  Text like ==h2 text== is rendered like <h2>h2 text</h2>.  
The number of "=" characters determines the header number.

$NetworkFile = 1;       # 1 = allow remote file:, 0 = no file:// links

  If enabled, file:// links to remote sites will be enabled.  Local
file:// links are disabled because of possible problems with links
like file:///C:/Windows/calc.exe (substituting a bad program instead).

$BracketWiki = 0;       # 1 = [WikiLnk txt] link, 0 = no local descriptions

  In 0.90, text like [WikiLink any text here] became a link which looked
like [any text here], pointing to WikiLink.  This occasionally caused
problems with things like category lists like [CategoryAlpha CategoryBeta].
This behavior is now optional, and is disabled by default.  If you want
the 0.90 behavior of local described-links, change this setting to 1.
